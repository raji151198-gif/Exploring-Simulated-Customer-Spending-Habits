The synthetic dataset shows a moderately positive relationship between annual income and monthly spending. The spending score distribution is fairly concentrated, with most customers falling in the mid‑range. Higher‑income customers tend to have higher spending scores, though some variation appears due to noise. Ages are evenly distributed across 18–75 and do not strongly influence spending in this simulation.
